                <h1>TURTLES</h1>
                <p>Turtles are reptiles that have been around for more than 220 million years,<br> making them one of the oldest reptile groups. They are fascinating creatures with unique characteristics,<br> such as their protective shell and ability to retract their heads and limbs into their shells for protection.<br>

                    Turtles can be found in various environments such as oceans, rivers, lakes, and even deserts.<br> There are over 350 species of turtles, with the largest being the leatherback sea turtle,<br> which can grow up to 7 feet in length and weigh over 2,000 pounds.<br>
                    
                    Turtles play an important role in their ecosystem as they help to control populations of certain aquatic<br> plants and animals.They also provide a source of food for many predators, such as birds and other reptiles.<br>
                    
                    Unfortunately, many species of turtles are endangered due to human activities such as habitat destruction,<br> overhunting, and pollution. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect these incredible animals<br> and ensure their survival for future generations.<br><br><br></p>

                <h1>Turtles in Sri Lanaka</h1>
                <p>
                    Today there are 250 species of turtles on earth.
                    Seven of these live in the ocean and are called sea turtles.
                    The remaining 243 species live on land or in freshwater ponds and marshes. 
                    The terrestrial turtles, those that live solely on land, are called tortoises.
                    Five of the seven species of sea turtles in the world visit the shores of Sri Lanka to breed. 
                    They are the Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas), Hawksbill Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), 
                    Olive Ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea), Loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and Leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea). 
                    The sea turtles are called Kesbawa in Sinhala and Amai in Tamil.

                        <h3>Green Sea Turtle</h3>
                        <p>The green turtle is one of the largest sea turtles and the only herbivore among the different species. 
                        Green turtles are in fact named for the greenish color of their cartilage and fat, 
                        not their shells. In the Eastern Pacific, a group of green turtles that have darker 
                        shells are called black turtles by the local community. 
                        Green turtles are found mainly in tropical and subtropical waters. 
                        Like other sea turtles, they migrate long distances between feeding grounds 
                        and the beaches from where they hatched. Classified as endangered, 
                        green turtles are threatened by overharvesting of their eggs, 
                        hunting of adults, being caught in fishing gear and loss of nesting beach sites.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="turtles-col">
                        <h3>Hawksbill Sea Turtle</h3>
                        <p>The Hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a marine turtle that is listed as critically
                            endangered by the World Conservation Union as a result of poachers seeking its beautiful
                         ‘tortoise-shell’, which is commercially valuable, human consumption of tortoise 
                         flesh & eggs in addition to the reptile getting wedged in fishing gear. In appearance it is dark 
                         golden brown in colour with reddish orange streaks, its most distinctive feature being the thick 
                         scutes that make up its hard upper shell. The Hawksbill turtle is relatively small to medium in size 
                         with an elongated head that tapers into a pointed hawk-like beak. Its habitat is mainly coral reefs 
                         and shallow lagoons where it feeds on sponges, fish, sea anemones and jellyfish amongst others.

                    <div class="turtles-col">
                        <h3>Olive Ridley</h3>
                        <p>The Olive Ridley Sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea) is found existing in the warm waters of 
                        the Indian Ocean. It is relatively small in size with a black heart shaped upper exoskeleton 
                        that turns olive green in adulthood. It averages 60-70 centimeters in length, with a weight not 
                        exceeding 50kg. The Olive Ridley, known to be the sea turtle found most abundantly comes ashore 
                        in a unique phenomenon known as “arribada” where large groups of females come all at once to nest.
                        The Olive Ridley feeds mainly on jellyfish, shrimp, mollusks and fish and has an average lifespan 
                        of 50 years.</p>

                        <h3>Loggerhead Sea Turtle</h3>
                        <p>The Loggerhead Sea turtle (Caretta caretta) is reddish brown in colour with a slightly heart shaped 
                        top shell and relatively large head. The adult length is approximately three feet with an adult weighing
                        around 250 pounds (113 kg).These marine reptiles are found mostly in salt water sometimes hundreds of 
                        miles out in the ocean and also in estuarine habitats such as bays, lagoons and salt marshes with females 
                        coming ashore momentarily for nesting. Being carnivores it feeds mainly on marine invertebrates, especially
                        hard shelled crustaceans, which it devours with its powerful jaws. It is believed that the Loggerhead Sea 
                        turtle’s lifespan is approximately 50 years.</p>

                        <h3>Leatherback Sea Turtle</h3>
                        <p>The Leatherback Sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) is known as the largest of all living turtles and the 
                        fourth heaviest modern day reptile. It can be recognized by its large grayish-black teardrop shaped body 
                        covered by skin and oily flesh and the seven prominent ridges that run from the front to the back of its 
                        body. The Leatherback sea turtle grows up to seven feet (two meters) and is known to weigh over 2000 pounds 
                        (900 kg). Its hydrodynamic body shape along with a large pair of front flippers helps it to move strongly 
                        through the water, where it feeds mainly on jellyfish and other small sea animals</p>
